# Implementation board

Tracks the phases of the build specification (§127). Each phase leaves working,
tested software and is committed separately. Status is updated as work lands.

| Phase | Scope | Acceptance | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Architecture, ADRs, glossary, threat model skeleton, monorepo, contracts, gokit | Docs + schemas + Makefile + compose base + shared Go kit (unit + integration tests green) | done |
| 1 | Walking skeleton: auth dev flow, projects/agents/versions, trace-service, OTel collector, Python SDK, demo agent, web trace page | `make dev` → demo agent trace visible in browser | done |
| 2 | Scenarios, declarative stateful tool twin, fault injection, simulation runs + UI | happy path and timeout-after-mutation scenarios run | pending |
| 3 | Evaluators (deterministic, trajectory, judge adapter), datasets, eval runs, baseline vs candidate | candidate regression detected | pending |
| 4 | Graph, manifest/OpenAPI/MCP import, observed edges, change set, bounded blast radius, impacted selection | prompt/tool change selects refund scenarios with reasons | pending |
| 5 | Release, gate rules, immutable evidence, CLI CI output, release UI | bad candidate BLOCKED | pending |
| 6 | Regression miner: features, embeddings, grouping, taxonomy, inbox, promotion | demo failure → regression case → auto-included in next gate | pending |
| 7 | Runtime gateway: CEL policies, approvals, idempotency, SSRF-safe proxy, audit | over-limit refund requires approval; tampered args rejected | pending |
| 8 | Tenant isolation, SSRF, redaction, chaos, load, security, E2E, docs, screenshots | Definition of Done checklist | pending |

## Phase 1 evidence (2026-09-24)

Commands run on the Phase 1 commit, with their results:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `make reset` (drop volumes, `make dev`: build, start, wait healthy, seed) | stack healthy in 89 s; 4 manifests registered, 40 conversations, 18 verified outcomes reported |
| `make demo` | one refund conversation through the demo agent; trace link printed |
| `make doctor` | 0 failed, 2 warnings (development placeholder secrets; events queued for the not-yet-built graph and evaluation services) |
| `make e2e` | 5/5 Playwright tests against the fresh stack (screenshots in `docs/screenshots/phase1-*.png`) |
| `make lint` | gofmt clean, `go vet` clean, golangci-lint 0 issues, ruff + ruff format + mypy (strict) clean, Prettier + ESLint + `tsc` clean |
| `make test` | Go: 101 tests + 81 subtests pass with real PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ (0 skipped); Python: 97 (SDK 67, demo 19, contracts check 11); web: 59 |
| `go test -race ./packages/... ./services/...` (integration) | all packages pass |
| `make contracts-check` | 14 event schemas compatible with the baseline (Phase 1 changes verified additive against Phase 0) |
| SDK overhead benchmark | tool span p50 ≈ 43 µs (content off), ≈ 91 µs (redacted) — `docs/benchmarks/sdk-overhead.md` |

lists the exact commands and test counts that were run).
